# KeyForge

Keyforge is a high-performance, highly scalable, and fault-tolerant key-value store that can be used in:

1. **Caching**:

   - Keeping frequently used data ready for fast access, like storing a copy of your favorite website for quicker loading.

2. **Session Management**:

   - Saving user sessions, like when a website remembers you're logged in, even if you refresh the page.

3. **Configuration Storage**:

   - Storing settings for applications that need to change based on the environment, like a game adapting its controls for different players.

4. **Event Tracking**:

   - Keeping track of events in real-time systems, like logging actions in a multiplayer game.

5. **Metadata Storage**:
   - Saving extra information about files or data, like descriptions of photos in a photo-sharing app.

And in a lot more usecases.
